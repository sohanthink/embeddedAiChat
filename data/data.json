          "description": "Are you interested in learning how to develop RFID/NFC firmware applications from scratch? NFC stands for Near Field Communication. This is how we do things like wireless payment cards, subway cards, bus cards etc. So if you are interested in learning how to develop systems such these then take a look at our Embedded NFC Complete System Development pack. This pack will take you from knowing nothing about RFID/NFC to building a complete NFC system that includes a robust firmware and modern desktop application with cloud connectivity. This is how we are going to accomplish that. The pack is made up of two courses. The first course, Embedded RFID/NFC Bare- Metal Development can be broadly divided into a theoretical part and a practical part. Embedded RFID/NFC Bare- Metal Development In the theoretical part we focus on the following: Theoretical Part Understanding RFID and its working principles Understanding the protocols and architecture of RFID Understanding the standards and regulations around RFID Understanding the working principles of Near Field Communication (NFC) Understanding the differences between RFID and NFC Understanding the various NFC card types and their merits Understanding the memory organisation and access conditions of MIFARE cards Practical Part In the practical part we focus on the following: Developing bare-metal drivers for interfacing the MIFARE MFRC522 NFC chips with the STM32 microcontroller Developing a library for handling communications between NFC cards and readers Developing a firmware application for controlling devices and triggering events using NFC cards and tags. The Second course, NFC Desktop Application focuses on developing a modern desktop application for receiving NFC card data and storing the data in the cloud. NFC Desktop Application Development Key sections in this course include: Python Essential Training This section provides practical python essential training for embedded developers. This section is for developers who are not familiar with the python programming language and those who want to brush up on their python development skills. Python GUI Development with Kivy This section deals with developing modern GUI desktop application using python and the Kivy framework. In this section we learn how develop complete, packaged, and installable applications from scratch. We shall apply these skills later on to develop the front end of nfc system. Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication In this section we shall integrate user authentication and a realtime database to store the card information in a cloud database. Developing the NFC Desktop Application In this final section, we shall apply all that we learned do develop the NFC desktop application. As always, no copy/paste. We write each line code from scratch.",

Key features of C++ such as template programming and object-oriented programming can greatly improve embedded software portability, in recent years this has made C++ very attractive to embedded developers. The goal of this course is to teach you how to navigate the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely bare-metal Embedded-C++ and register manipulations. By the end of this course you will be able to write drivers for peripherals like ADC, UART, PWM, GPIO, TIMER, I2C, SPI, etc. You will also master the ARM architecture and how to build professional embedded firmware for ARM processors. Furthermore, you will master C++ key features like Object-Oriented methods, Template Programming, and optimization.",

This course uses the STM32 microcontroller and the ESP8266 WIFI chip. The ESP8266 is a low-cost WIFI chip with a full TCP/IP stack and a microcontroller. If you do not understand what TCP/IP stack means, do not worry, by the end of this course you will understand this and much more. The course can be divided into four parts. The first part is theoretical. In this part we shall learn about some networking concepts and the fundamentals of the WIFI protocol. In the next part of the course we shall develop bare-metal drivers for interfacing the ESP8266 chip to the STM32 microcontroller. After developing our drivers for connecting the ESP8266 chip to the STM32 microcontroller we shall then go ahead and develop efficient data structures for managing communication data between the ESP8266 chip and the STM32 microcontroller. In the final part we shall combine the drivers and data structures developed in the previous parts to develop a library for connecting to the internet. We shall then go on to use the library to develop a WebServer, a Web Client as well as accomplish tasks such as storing sensor data in the cloud and so much more. Please take a look at the full course curriculum. Develop a Complete WIFI Library for ESP8266 and STM32 Microcontrollers Develop an Embedded WIFI Client for Accessing Web APIs Develop an Embedded Web Server for Controlling Hardware Remotely Develop Bare-Metal Firmware for Storing Sensor Data in the Cloud Develop Bare-Metal Drivers for Connecting ESP8266 to STM32 Microcontrollers Develop First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Data Structure for Managing Communication Data Develop Circular Buffer Data Structure for Managing Communication Data Understand the Fundamentals of the IEEE 802.11 (WIFI) Protocol Please take a look at the full course curriculum.",
