This version of the courses use the platform agnostic GNU syntax supported by the GNU assembler (as). Unlike the ARM Assembly Programming From Ground Up™ 1 &2 courses which use Keil uVision which available on the Windows operating system only, the ARM GNU Assembly Programming From Ground Up™ course teaches you how to write assembly programs for the GNU assembler which is available on Windows, OSX and Linux. Covering ARM Systems Design, Architecture and Practical Assembly Programming, this is the most comprehensive ARM assembly course online. I'll take you step-by-step through engaging and fun video tutorials and teach you everything you need to know to succeed as an ARM embedded developer. By the end of this course you will master the ARM Instruction Set, the Thumb Instruction Set and the Thumb-2 Instruction Set. You will be able to create data structures such as FIFOs in assembly. You will also be able to create Finite State Machines such as the Moore Machine using only assembly code. Furthermore, this course teaches you how to navigate the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers and firmware. To achieve this goal, no libraries are used in this course, purely ARM Assembly Language. You will be able to write peripheral drivers in assembly-ADC, UART, SYSTICK, GPIO, GPTM. Specially Designed For People Who Hate Copy/Paste Listen. If you don’t like “Copy/Paste” you’re not alone. I can’t stand it either. I’d literally rather have a piece of code that I wrote from scratch that doesn’t work than someone else’s working code I copied and pasted. And that’s why I’ve spent months designing and recording this course in which I show you how to locate every single register used and the meaning of every hexadecimal value written into the register. By the end of this course... You Will Be Able To : Master the ARM Instruction Set Master the Thumb and Thumb-2 Instruction Sets Write Complex programs in Assembly Language Implement State Machines in Assembly Language Implement Data Structures in Assembly Language Write ADC Drivers in Assembly Language Write UART Drivers in Assembly Language Write GPTM Drivers in Assembly Language Write GPIO Drivers in Assembly Language",

This course has many sections but primarily the course can be divided into three parts.\n\nThe first part deals with peripheral driver development. In this part we master how to use the STM32CubeMX framework to setup the clocks and register parameters of our peripheral drivers and then go on to the CubeIDE development environment to complete the development and testing of peripheral drivers. We shall master different setup configurations of our peripheral drivers in this part. These peripherals include the Universal Serial Bus (USB), the PWM, the SPI, the ADC, UART and the DMA.\n\nThe second part of this master course deals with developing embedded firmware applications using some of the Middleware provided by the STM32CubeMX framework. One of such Middleware we shall master is the FreeRTOS Realtime Kernel. We shall see how to use STM32CubeMX to create tasks and semaphores and other kernel components for realtime firmware development. We shall also see how to develop these kernel components from scratch using our CubeIDE development environment alone.\n\nThe third part of the course deals with working the CubeIDE as a standalone development environment. Over here we shall see how to develop bare-metal embedded-c firmware and drivers without using any libraries. We shall literally download the microcontroller chip's datasheet and develop our firmware and drivers using information from the datasheet only. We shall then go on to use this same datasheet information to develop firmware and peripheral drivers using ARM Assembly Language.\n\n2.Embedded Systems STM32 HAL APIs Driver Development\n\nThe STM32 Low-Layer APIs ( as known as LL) offers a fast light-weight expert-oriented layer which is closer to the hardware than the HAL APIs (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The LL offers low-level APIs at the register level with better optimization. These require deep knowledge of the MCU and peripheral specifications which we shall cover in this course.\n\nWith a programming based approach, this course is designed to give you a solid foundation in firmware and peripheral driver development for the STM32 family of microcontrollers. The goal of this course is to teach you how to navigate the microcontrollers reference manual and datasheet to extract the right information to professionally build peripheral drivers and firmware using the STM32 Low-Layer APIs\n\nBy the end of this course you will be able to develop drivers for peripherals like the ADC, UART,PWM, GPIO, TIMER,I2C, SPI, RTC, WWDG, IWDG, RCC, EXTI etc. You will also master the STM32 architecture and how to build professional embedded firmware for STM32 microcontrollers.\n\n3.Embedded Systems STM32 Low-Layer APIs(LL) Driver Development\n\nThe STM32 Low-Layer APIs ( as known as LL) offers a fast light-weight expert-oriented layer which is closer to the hardware than the HAL APIs (Hardware Abstraction Layer).

          "description": "Hello Welcome to the Mastering STM32CubeMX 5 and CubeIDE course.\n\nThis course teaches you how to build embedded systems firmware and peripheral drivers using the STM32CubeMX 5 framework and the STMCubeIDE development environment. This course has many sections but primarily the course can be divided into three parts.\n\nThe first part deals with peripheral driver development. In this part, we master how to use the STM32CubeMX framework to set up the clocks and register parameters of our peripheral drivers and then go on to the CubeIDE development environment to complete the development and testing of peripheral drivers. We shall master different setup configurations of our peripheral drivers in this part. These peripherals include the Universal Serial Bus (USB), the PWM, the SPI, the ADC, UART, and the DMA.\n\nThe second part of this master course deals with developing embedded firmware applications using some of the Middleware provided by the STM32CubeMX framework. One such Middleware we shall master is the FreeRTOS Realtime Kernel. We shall see how to use STM32CubeMX to create tasks and semaphores and other kernel components for realtime firmware development. We shall also see how to develop these kernel components from scratch using our CubeIDE development environment alone.\n\nThe third part of the course deals with working the CubeIDE as a standalone development environment. Over here we shall see how to develop bare-metal embedded-c firmware and drivers without using any libraries. We shall literally download the microcontroller chip's datasheet and develop our firmware and drivers using information from the datasheet only. We shall then go on to use this same datasheet information to develop firmware and peripheral drivers using ARM Assembly Language.\n\nPlease take a look at the full course curriculum.\n\nREMEMBER: I have no doubt you will love this course. Also, it comes with a FULL money-back guarantee for 30 days! So put simply, you really have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nSign up and let's start building some drivers.",

The HAL drivers include a complete set of ready-to-use APIs that simplify the user application implementation. For example, the communication peripherals contain APIs to initialize and configure the peripheral, manage data transfers in polling mode, handle interrupts or DMA, and manage communication errors.\n\nIn summary, the HAL offers high-level and feature-oriented APIs with a high-portability level.
